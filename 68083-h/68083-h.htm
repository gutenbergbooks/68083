<p><span class="smcap">Setting</span>—Interior of schoolroom. Chairs arranged
in rows for scholars; desk and chair for
teacher; blackboard.</p>

<p>(Enter teacher. Severe-looking, wearing eye-glasses.
Arranges books and papers on desk.
Rings bell.)</p>

<p>(Enter scholars, singly and in groups, talking
and laughing until teacher again taps bell. They
wear varied costumes, gingham aprons, etc. On
entering remove coats, caps, shawls, hats and
bonnets—in season and out of season—hanging
them on hooks in the wall or on backs of chairs.
Hair in pig-tails or curls tied with ribbons or
shoestrings in all manner of fashions.)</p>

<p>Each has basket, bag or tin dinner-pail.</p>

<p>Teacher opens roll-book and proceeds to call
roll.</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “Annabel Adams.”</p>

<p><i>Annabel Adams.</i> “Present.”</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “Bessie Bolitsky.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span><i>Bessie Bolitsky.</i> “P-r-r-esent!”</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “Curiosity Cornhusk.”</p>

<p><i>Curiosity Cornhusk.</i> “Present.”</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “Dennis Dockerty.”</p>

<p><i>Dennis Dockerty.</i> “Present.”</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “Etta Elephant.”</p>

<p><i>Etta Elephant</i> (fat child). “I’m here.”</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “Fanny Finney.”</p>

<p><i>Fanny Finney</i> (brogue). “Hyer.”</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “Geraldine Griggs.”</p>

<p><i>Geraldine Griggs.</i> “Present.”</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “Henry Hoskins.”</p>

<p><i>Henry Hoskins.</i> “Pr-r-esent.”</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “Isaac Ibsen.”</p>

<p><i>Isaac Ibsen.</i> “We’s both here.”</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “Silence! Next time answer as you
should.” (Proceeds.) “Ira Ibsen.”</p>

<p><i>Ira Ibsen</i> (very faintly). “Present.”</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “Joshua Judkins.”</p>

<p><i>Joshua Judkins.</i> “Present.”</p>

<p>(Other names may be added.)</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “First class in geography, come forward.”</p>

<p>(Advance Annabel, Dennis, Etta, Curiosity
and Joshua.)</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “Now Annabel, you tell me this. If
to the right of you is the South, and on your
left the North, and in front of you the East—what’s
behind you?”</p>

<p>Annabel thinks a moment, then starts to cry.
“Boo hoo! I knowed it. I told ma you’d see
them buttons missin’ off my waist.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span><i>Teacher.</i> “Ridiculous! I mean the West.
Now listen children! Does anybody remember
what the population of China is?” (All shake
heads negatively.)</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “Well, the population of China is so
great that two Chinamen die every time you take
a breath.”</p>

<p>(Etta immediately starts purring furiously.
Keeps it up until spoken to.)</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “Dennis Dockerty go to the board
and draw the map of New Jersey.”</p>

<p>(Dennis goes, but draws instead a tree, one
branch of which is longer than the others, and
has on it three disks representing fruit.)</p>

<p><i>Teacher</i> (just then observing Etta’s flushed
face and energetic puffs): “Why Etta Elephant,
what’s the matter? What on earth are you
doing?”</p>

<p><i>Etta Elephant.</i> “Killing Chinamen. I never
did like them foreigners what me father calls
aliens, and I’m getting rid of them as fast as I
can.”</p>

<p>(Teacher throws up hands in exasperation.
Turns to blackboard.)</p>

<p>“Why Dennis Dockerty that’s not the map of
New Jersey.”</p>

<p><i>Dennis.</i> “Please, ma’am, my big brother says
New Jersey’s like a fruit tree, ’cause it’s got a
Long Branch, three Oranges and a Lemon.”</p>

<p><i>Teacher</i> (meditatively): “Y-e-s, East Orange,
West Orange and South Orange—but where’s
the Lemon?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span><i>Dennis</i> (saucily). “You’re the Lemon.”</p>

<p><i>Other Scholars.</i> “O-h-h!”</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “Go to your seat.”</p>

<p>(Dennis goes, shuffling his feet and sulking for
some time.)</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “Curiosity, your father is a sailor;
would it be possible for him to start to-day to
go round the world, and keep sailing always in
the same direction till he came back to his starting-point?”</p>

<p><i>Curiosity.</i> “No, Miss Fitzimmons, pop’s laid
up with rheumatism.”</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “Dear me! What ails you all to be
so stupid to-day. Joshua, have we anything in
our country as wonderful as the great volcano,
Mt. Vesuvius, which continually pours out smoke
and molten lava?”</p>

<p><i>Joshua.</i> “Sure—give Niagara Falls a chance,
it will put the whole thing out in a minute.”</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “Very good. You may take your
seats.”</p>

<p>(Class obey.)</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “Next is the class in General Information.
Forward.”</p>

<p>(Advance Bessie, Geraldine, Fanny, Henry,
Isaac and Ira.)</p>

<p>(In the meantime Etta is seen chewing gum
vigorously, and planting her feet conspicuously
in the aisle as she fidgets about.)</p>

<p><i>Teacher</i> (impressively). “Bessie, tell me what
you would think if you saw the Stars and Stripes
waving over the field of battle?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span><i>Bessie</i> (innocently). “I’d think that the wind
was blowing.”</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “Awful!” (observes Etta). “Etta
Elephant, take your gum out of your mouth, and
put your feet in immediately.” (Etta does this
literally in pantomime.)</p>

<p>(Just then Curiosity pipes up, raising hand as
she asks.) “Teacher, did you ever see a hair
die?”</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “Certainly <i>not</i>.”</p>

<p><i>Curiosity Cornhusk.</i> “Or ink stand?”</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “<i>No!</i> Do be quiet.” (Turns to
class.) “Now do you know whether any one is
going to try to discover the South Pole?”</p>

<p><i>Fanny.</i> “Oi ain’t going.”</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “Oh, Fanny, my child, you must not
say, ‘I ain’t going.’ You must say, ‘I am not
going.’ It’s like this: ‘I am not going; he is
not going; she is not going; we are not going;
you are not going; they are not going.’ Now,
can you say all that Fanny?”</p>

<p><i>Fanny.</i> “Shure Oi can. ‘There ain’t nobody
going.’”</p>

<p>Teacher waves her aside in despair. Asks
others: “Which of you can describe the backbone?”</p>

<p><i>Geraldine</i> (raises hand, standing on one foot
in her eagerness to answer). “The backbone is
something that holds up the head and ribs, and
keeps you from having legs clear up your neck.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span><i>Teacher.</i> “Now, children, what is a cat covered
with? Is it wool? Is it fur? Is it feathers?
Is it hair?”</p>

<p><i>Curiosity</i> (pipes up): “Say, ain’t you honest
never seen a cat?”</p>

<p>(The others answer in chorus): “Fur.”</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “Geraldine, what is dew?”</p>

<p><i>Geraldine.</i> “The earth revolves on its own
axis three hundred and sixty-five times in twenty-four
hours. This rapid motion through space
causes it to perspire. This is called dew.”</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “Henry, where was the Declaration
of Independence signed?”</p>

<p><i>Henry.</i> “At the bottom, ma’am.”</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “What is mathematics, Isaac?”</p>

<p><i>Isaac.</i> “Dunno.”</p>

<p><i>Ira.</i> “Me neither.”</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “Well, mathematics is the science
that treats of measurement or numbering. For
instance: If it takes one man twelve days to build
a house, then twelve men can build it in one
day. That’s mathematics.”</p>

<p>(Isaac and Ira put heads together over pencil
and paper while teacher asks next question.)</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “Bessie, if your mother bought four
baskets of grapes, the dealer’s price being a quarter
a basket, how much would the purchase cost
her?”</p>

<p><i>Bessie.</i> “You never can tell. Ma’s great at a
bargain.”</p>

<p>(Isaac and Ira wave their hands to attract
attention.)</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span><i>Teacher.</i> “Well, Isaac? Well, Ira?”</p>

<p><i>Isaac.</i> “Say Miss Fitzimmons, me’n Ira’s figgered
out that two hundred and eighty-eight
men will build it in one hour; seventeen thousand
two hundred and eighty, in a minute,
and—”</p>

<p><i>Ira</i> (interrupts). “And one million, thirty-six
thousand eight hundred men will put it up in a
second, an’—”</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “There, that will do—that’s quite
enough. I see you understand the meaning of
mathematics fully.”</p>

<p><i>Curiosity</i> (raises hand and asks). “Please,
teacher, did you ever see a stone step, or a bed
spring, or a apple turn over?”</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “Curiosity Cornhusk, I want you to
stop asking questions at once. Don’t you know
that curiosity once killed a cat?” (Curiosity is
thoughtful.) “Children, you may all take your
seats.”</p>

<p><i>Curiosity.</i> “Please, teacher, what was it the
cat wanted to know?”</p>

<p><i>Teacher</i> (sinks into chair). “Somebody bring
me a glass of water, quick!”</p>

<p>(Geraldine gravely goes to pail in the corner
and brings a large tin dipper full. Teacher revives.)</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “Children I wanted to speak to you
about that poor family who have just moved into
the old brown house in the Hollow. The father
is just getting up from a sick-bed and not able
to work yet and I hear there’s scarcely a thing to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
eat in the house, and to-morrow is Thanksgiving,
you know. I do wish we could send them a
good dinner. Can any of you think of a way
to manage it without asking too much of our
parents?”</p>

<p>(A loud knock is heard at the outer door.
While teacher answers it scholars occupy themselves
with throwing spit-balls, and various
pranks of school children. She returns.)</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “There are two automobiles just
down the hill. They got off the main road by
mistake, and one of them is broken down, and
the men are trying to get it fixed up. They
wanted to know if there was any place near here
where they could get something to eat. The one
at the door says they’re ‘positively starving,’
and would be willing to pay a good round sum
for anything fit to eat. You know there is no
house nearer than old Mr. Dawson’s and—”</p>

<p><i>Annabel.</i> “Don’t send ’em there, teacher;
Mis’ Dawson is just doin’ her washin’ to-day,
and she’ll most likely have a cold bite.”</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “That’s true—and the next place is
Mr. Temple’s—”</p>

<p><i>Curiosity.</i> “I saw ’em drivin’ off to town as
I came by, an’ the house was all shut up.”</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “Then there’s quite a stretch between
there and your place, Bessie.”</p>

<p><i>Bessie.</i> “Mercy! Don’t send them there, Miss
Fitzimmons. Mother’s makin’ mince-meat and
cookin’ up pumpkin for pies, and she’d be all
upset.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span><i>Teacher.</i> “Well, it appears there isn’t very
good promise of lunch for these wayfarers unless
we help them out. What do you say if we
sell our lunches to them and take the proceeds
to buy supplies for the folks down in the Hollow?
We only have a short session after recess
on account of the holiday, so you wouldn’t get
so terribly hungry before you go home. I’ll
leave you here for awhile, and if you decide to
make this sacrifice you can place your lunches
on my desk.”</p>

<p>(Scholars immediately begin discussion; some
for, some against proposed disposal of lunches;
all talking at once and moving about.)</p>

<p>(Presently Annabel rises, sighs and slowly advances
to desk, placing basket there, and saying:)
“I hate to give up that piece of pumpkin pie, but
I couldn’t relish it thinking of that Hollow family;
I’ve been hollow myself.” (This is funnier
if the speaker is a stout girl.)</p>

<p><i>Bessie</i> (follows her example). “All I hope is
that the stew don’t all get et up before I get
home to-day.”</p>

<p><i>Curiosity.</i> “Guess I’ll keep mine.”</p>

<p><i>Dennis.</i> “I love my lunch, but oh! them hungry
kids.” (Goes forward.)</p>

<p><i>Geraldine.</i> “Guess I’m as generous as anybody.”
(Adds her lunch.)</p>

<p><i>Etta</i> to <i>Curiosity</i>. “You’d ought to be
ashamed of yourself.” (Arises.) “My lunch is
out in the cloak-room; I’ll go get it.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>(While she is gone, Curiosity puts her lunch
with the rest, sighing:) “I’ll do it, but I guess
I’ll die like that Curiosity cat; I’ll be so hungry.”
(Thoughtfully.) “Wonder what that cat <i>did</i>
want to know anyhow.”</p>

<p><i>Joshua.</i> “Guess if they can stand them biscuits
of Sis’s, I oughtn’t to kick.”</p>

<p>(Etta returns with huge basket, which she
deposits with an air of importance on the desk.
Looks contemptuously at Curiosity.)</p>

<p><i>Fanny.</i> “And I bet you we won’t have nothin’
but fried praties and onions for supper. But
maybe <i>they</i> ain’t got even them.” (Puts bag
with others.)</p>

<p>(Isaac and Ira go up together, saying:) “And
there’s ours.”</p>

<p><i>Henry.</i> “Here’s mine, too.”</p>

<p><i>Etta</i> to <i>Curiosity</i>. “There, you see; everybody’s
give up their lunch but you, you little
stingy, contrary, stubborn, selfish, tight-fisted,
over-fed, pie-faced pig you—”</p>

<p><i>Curiosity.</i> “Are you through?”</p>

<p><i>Etta.</i> “Yes.”</p>

<p><i>Curiosity.</i> “Ain’t you got nothin’ more to
say?”</p>

<p><i>Etta.</i> “No.”</p>

<p><i>Curiosity.</i> “Well, all of them things you called
me you are. I put my lunch there when you
went after yours.”</p>

<p><i>Etta</i> (repentently). “Oh, I take it all back.”</p>

<p><i>Curiosity</i> (cordially). “All right, you’re welcome.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>(Enter teacher.)</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “Ah, this looks as if everybody has
been generous. I’m proud of you. You’re all
true friends in need. But I was sure you’d do
it, so I spoke to the gentleman at the door and
he says, he will consider it a bargain at any price
we say, and will be back with his friends soon.
Now for the recitations. Each one of you try
to recite something, if only a stanza. And after
all have recited, I will call for the fire drill, and
all be ready to respond immediately. Don’t hesitate,
do as you would if the building was really
on fire. Now, Annabel you’re first on the roll,
so you begin speaking.”</p>

<p>Annabel comes forward, bows, announces:
“Mary’s Little Lamb.” Bows again, and recites
as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Some folks say that fleas is black,</div>
<div class="indent">But that ain’t true I know,</div>
<div class="verse">For Mary had a little lamb</div>
<div class="indent">Its fleas was white as snow.”</div>
</div></div>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “Now Bessie, it’s your turn.”</p>

<p><i>Bessie.</i> “Me and Curiosity’s got one together.”</p>

<p><i>Curiosity.</i></p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>(Miss Fitzsimmons sits at her desk arranging
some papers. Laughter and talking is heard,
followed by the entrance of the automobile
party of six persons.)</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Morrison</i>, a stout, elderly lady.</p>

<p><i>May Morrison</i>, her daughter, affected young
lady.</p>

<p><i>Betty Bennet</i>, May’s friend.</p>

<p><i>Charley Chadwick</i>, May’s beau, something of
a “smarty,” but a “good sort.”</p>

<p><i>Mr. and Mrs. Brown</i>, an affectionate couple.</p>


<p><i>May Morrison</i> (ecstatically). “Oh, what a
perfectly darling place! The veritable little old
red schoolhouse.”</p>

<p>(Miss Fitzsimmons sniffs audibly as she looks
her over disdainfully.)</p>

<p><i>Charley Chadwick</i> (taking her hand and skipping
with her down the aisle, sings):</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Morrison</i> (advances to the teacher’s
desk). “Good morning. Miss—ah?”</p>

<p><i>Teacher</i> (shortly). “Fitzsimmons.”</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> “Ah yes, of course. You are the
teacher, I presume?” (Miss Fitzsimmons nods.)
“Awfully nice of you to extend your hospitality
to us in this way.”</p>

<p><i>Mr. Brown</i> (joins in). “Yes, indeed, its great
of you to help us out.”</p>

<p><i>Charley</i> (facetiously). “Oh, no, Brown; this
is a case of our being ‘taken in.’”</p>

<p>(The girls giggle.)</p>

<p><i>Miss Fitzsimmons</i> (after a contemptuous
glance in his direction, responds quite graciously
to the others). “I’m sure I’m glad we could be
of service to you, and the children are pleased at
the prospect of helping the poor family, which
your generosity has made possible.”</p>

<p><i>Mr. Brown.</i> “Oh, don’t mention it.”</p>

<p><i>Miss Fitzsimmons.</i> “And you’ll find all the
lunches on those seats” (pointing to them). “I
hope you will enjoy them.” (Turns to her
papers. The others murmur their thanks and
proceed to remove their wraps, all but Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
Brown, who draws her fur more closely about
her throat.)</p>

<p><i>Mr. Brown.</i> “Cold, dearie?”</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> (plaintively). “Simply freezing,
honey.”</p>

<p><i>Charley</i> (aside to May). “Buzz! Buzz!”</p>

<p><i>Mr. Brown</i> (bustling about). “Where is the
radiator, anyhow?”</p>

<p><i>Miss Fitzsimmons.</i> “The <i>stove’s</i> up there at
the other end of the room.”</p>

<p><i>Charley.</i> “Oh, I say, Brown, let’s turn our
attention to the baskets now and hug the stove
afterwards. I’m completely caved in.”</p>

<p>(Mr. and Mrs. Brown gracefully agree to this,
and the opening of the baskets, bags and kettles
begins.)</p>

<p>(The door in view of the audience opens on
a crack and Curiosity’s hooded head appears
unnoticed by the occupants of the schoolroom,
and one after another the curious faces of the
children appear.)</p>

<p><i>Betty</i> (gleefully). “Oh! Oh! a cup of cranberry
jelly.” (Takes it out.)</p>

<p><i>May.</i> “And here are two simply luscious-looking
cakes with chocolate on top.”</p>

<p><i>Charley.</i> “Horray! pumpkin pie.”</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Brown.</i> “Oh, lovey, look! A great big,
juicy cruller.” (Holds it up.)</p>

<p><i>Mr. Brown.</i> “We’ll eat it together over by the
stove, pet.”</p>

<p><i>Charley.</i> “Going to eat the <i>whole</i> of it?”</p>

<p><i>May.</i> “Oh, Charley, you funny funny thing!”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>(They group themselves about and arrange
the viands on napkins found in the baskets.)</p>

<p>(Just then Charley espies the faces at the
door, which promptly bob out of sight, except
Curiosity’s.)</p>

<p><i>Charley.</i> “Hello there, sis! How’s all the
pigs up at your place?”</p>

<p><i>Curiosity.</i> “Oh, pretty well, thank you. How’s
all your folks?”</p>

<p>(Betty claps her hands.) “Good! good!”
(The others laugh, Charley included.)</p>

<p><i>Charley.</i> “Oh, I say! What’s your name,
anyhow?”</p>

<p><i>Curiosity.</i> “Same as father’s.”</p>

<p><i>Charley.</i> “Yes, I know that, but what’s father’s
now?”</p>

<p><i>Curiosity.</i> “Same’s mine.”</p>

<p><i>Charley.</i> “Well, but what do they say when
they call you to breakfast.”</p>

<p><i>Curiosity.</i> “They don’t never call me. I allers
git there first.”</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “Why, Curiosity, I thought you had
gone home.”</p>

<p><i>Curiosity.</i> “No’m. We thought we’d wait and
take our baskets home after they’re through
with ’em.”</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Morrison.</i> “Oh, let them stay, Miss—Persimmons.”</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “<i>Fitz</i>simmons.”</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Morrison.</i> “Oh, yes, of course, Fitzsimmons.
Let them all come in; there’s plenty here
for all of us and them, too.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span><i>May.</i> “Oh, yes, do. It’ll be a perfect circus.”</p>

<p>(Charley throws wide the door.) “Come in,
come in, friends, and help us eat up your
lunches.”</p>

<p>(The children, after much whispering and
“you go first,” troop in bashfully, giggling and
nudging one another, and the eating commences,
Mrs. Morrison presiding over the distribution
of the lunches.)</p>

<p><i>Charley</i> (munching a sandwich). “My, but
this chicken sandwich is prime. Who brought
it, anyway?”</p>

<p><i>Dennis</i> (shyly). “I did.”</p>

<p><i>Charley.</i> “Your own chickens?”</p>

<p><i>Dennis.</i> “Yes, sir.”</p>

<p><i>Charley.</i> “I should think you’d hate to chop
the heads off the poor chickens.”</p>

<p><i>Dennis.</i> “Oh, we get around that all right.”</p>

<p><i>Charley.</i> “How, now?”</p>

<p><i>Dennis.</i> “Oh, we chop the chickens off.”</p>

<p>(The grown-ups all laugh delightedly.)</p>

<p><i>Curiosity</i> (intently regarding Miss May’s enjoyment
of the generous portions of lunch at her
place and Charley’s attentions toward her), asks
Mr. Brown, “Is he going to marry her?” (indicating
them by a nod of her head).</p>

<p><i>Mr. Brown.</i> “I believe so.”</p>

<p><i>Curiosity.</i> “And buy her everything?”</p>

<p><i>Mr. Brown.</i> “Yes.”</p>

<p><i>Curiosity.</i> “Clo’s and dinners and ice-cream
and things?”</p>

<p><i>Mr. Brown.</i> “I presume so.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span><i>Curiosity.</i> “Well, that man’s got lots of courage,
ain’t he?”</p>

<p>(Mr. and Mrs. Brown laugh amusedly, and
Charley turns from a conversation with May to
ask), “Hello! now what’s the joke?”</p>

<p><i>Etta E.</i> “Oh, its her” (motions to Curiosity),
“she’s et so much of my tomato ketshup she’s
gettin’ sawcy.”</p>

<p><i>Curiosity.</i> “Well, you et that big apple out of
my basket.”</p>

<p><i>Etta.</i> “Well, here, plant the seeds and you can
have a whole orchard.” (Holds them out to her
provokingly.)</p>

<p><i>Charley</i> (to Annabel). “Well, sister, did you
make this pie?”</p>

<p><i>Annabel.</i> “No, sir. Ma did, though, and
she’ll write off how if you want me to ask her
to.”</p>

<p><i>Charley.</i> “Now that’s kind of you. Pray do.
How’d you like a good receipt for catching rabbits?”</p>

<p><i>Annabel</i> (staring). “Wh-y! I—I’d like to
have it.”</p>

<p><i>Charley.</i> “Well, you crouch down behind a
thick stone wall and make a noise like a turnip.”</p>

<p><i>Annabel.</i> “O—h!” (thinks it over).</p>

<p><i>Mr. Brown</i> (to Mrs. B.) “Isn’t this blackberry
jam delicious, sweetness?” (Gives her a
spoonful.) “But you’d know it reminds me of a
painful blunder I made once when visiting the
country, which I never want to repeat.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span><i>Mrs. Brown.</i> “Dear me! Did you mistake a
stranger for an acquaintance, honey?”</p>

<p><i>Mr. Brown.</i> “No, not exactly that, but I mistook
a bumblebee for a blackberry.”</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Brown.</i> “Oh, my!”</p>

<p><i>Annabel</i> (to Charley). “I can tell you a better
way to catch ’em.”</p>

<p><i>Charley.</i> “Catch what?”</p>

<p><i>Annabel.</i> “Why, them rabbits.”</p>

<p><i>Charley.</i> “How now?”</p>

<p><i>Annabel.</i> “You go and sit quietly in a bed
of cabbages and look natural.”</p>

<p>(The laugh is on Charley.)</p>

<p><i>May</i> (to Bessie Bolitsky). “Now I expect
you little girls know a perfectly awful lot, don’t
you? Can you tell me how many ribs you have?”</p>

<p><i>Bessie</i> (squirming and giggling). “I don’t
know, ma’am. I’m so awful ticklish I never
could count ’em.”</p>

<p><i>Mr. Brown</i> (to Fanny). “I hear we pass your
house on our way to the turnpike. I’d like to
stop and see your father about buying some of
these apples (eating one). Think he is home?”</p>

<p><i>Fanny.</i> “Oh, yes-sir. He’s worrikin’ down at
the end of the back lot where the pigs is. You’ll
know father ’cause he’s got a hat on.” (A burst
of laughter.)</p>

<p><i>Fanny</i> (indignantly). “Well, I don’t see what
you’re laughin’ at. The hired man’s got on a
cap.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span><i>Mrs. Morrison.</i> “I suppose you children know
lots about history. Now who can tell me the
name of the first man?”</p>

<p><i>Henry.</i> “George Washington.”</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> “Why do you think George Washington
was the first man?”</p>

<p><i>Henry.</i> “Because he was first in war, first in
peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen.”</p>

<p><i>Joshua.</i> “No, Henry. You’re way off. George
Washington couldn’t a’ been the first man ’cause
my history-book says he married a widow; so
there must a’ been another man way ahead of
him.”</p>

<p>(Laughter from grown-ups.)</p>

<p><i>May.</i> “You surely are well informed about
Washington. How about Lincoln?”</p>

<p><i>Geraldine.</i> “We’s just writing compositions
on him to hand in next Monday. I’ve got mine
here if you’l like to hear it.”</p>

<p><i>May.</i> “I’d simply love to.”</p>

<p><i>Betty.</i> “Oh, yes, do read it.”</p>

<p><i>Geraldine</i> (takes paper out of book and reads).
“Abraham Lincoln was born in Kentucky at a
very early age. His father moved the family to
Ohio, floating down the Mississippi. If he had
not been killed by a murderer he might be living
to-day. He was an intelligent man and could
easily have been President of New York City.”</p>

<p>(The grown-ups try to hide their smiles.)</p>

<p><i>May.</i> “Perfectly remarkable.”</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Morrison</i> (to Isaac). “Have another
sandwich, my boy, or a pickle or something.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span><i>Isaac.</i> “No’m, thanks; I’m full.”</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> “But surely you are not finished yet.
Why here is some delicious pie.”</p>

<p><i>Isaac.</i> “Yes’m, I’m saving my neck for that.”</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Brown</i> (to Annabel). “And this little
girl has stopped eating, too. Do take another
cake.”</p>

<p><i>Annabel</i> (with a sigh, as she takes the proffered
cake). “Well, I’ve quit swallerin’, but I
can chaw yet.”</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> (rising and going to the teacher’s
desk, where Miss Fitzsimmons is lunching while
she marks and arranges papers). “Well, my dear
Miss Fitzgibbons—”</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “Fitzsimmons.”</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> “Oh, of course, Fitzsimmons. My
dear Miss Fitzsimmons, this has been a most
enjoyable and unique occasion to us.”</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “I’m glad, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>(Mr. and Mrs. Brown join them.)</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> “We’ll remember it as one of the
events of our lives, won’t we, Rosebud?”</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> “Indeed we shall. It makes one wish
she were a little schoolgirl once again.”</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> (fondly aside). “And I a little schoolboy
to carry her books.”</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> “You dear, foolish boy.”</p>

<p><i>Charley.</i> “But, oh, say, Mrs. Morrison, before
we go let’s have a game of something or
other. What say, everybody?”</p>

<p><i>May and Betty.</i> “Oh, yes, let’s.”</p>

<p><i>Children.</i> “Oh let’s do.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span><i>Charley.</i> “What shall it be?”</p>

<p><i>Children cry.</i> “Ring-around-a-rosey,” “Puss-in-the-corner”
and “London Bridge.”</p>

<p><i>Charley.</i> “Well, let’s see; that’s three to choose
from. How many say Ring-around-a-rosey, hold
up your hands.”</p>

<p>(A few of the children’s hands are raised.)</p>

<p><i>Charley.</i> “Now Puss-in-the-corner. How
many am I bid for Puss-in-the-corner?”</p>

<p>(A few more hands are raised.)</p>

<p><i>Charley.</i> “Now for London Bridge. Going—going—gone.”</p>

<p>(The other children and all of the grown-ups
hands are raised except the teacher’s and Mrs.
Morrison’s, who stand aside laughing.)</p>

<p><i>Charley.</i> “London Bridge has it. You come
on, too, Mamma Morrison and Miss Teacher.
Everybody forward. Who’ll be London Bridge?
You do, Betty and May, and come on, the rest
of you. Line up behind me and we’ll storm the
bridge.”</p>

<p>(The two young ladies join hands, and the
others, headed by Charley—Mrs. Morrison and
the teacher protestingly joining, coaxed by the
children—pass under the arched hands, singing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse">Falling down, falling down.</div>
<div class="verse">London Bridge is falling down,</div>

<p>May and Betty drop their hands around the
person going under the arch as the word “lady”
is sung.)</p>
